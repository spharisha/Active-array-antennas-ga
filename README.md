#Active array antenna element failure pattern analysis and synthesis using Genetic Algorithm

##Description
A heuristic method using Genetic Algorithm(GA) is proposed for element failure mitigation
in Active antenna arrays. It may happen that some of the individual elements of an array 
of active elements may go faulty resulting in pattern distortion of the antenna pattern. 
This reduces the efficiency of target detection. To rectify this element failure, 
GA is used to optimally mitigate the element failure effect.
